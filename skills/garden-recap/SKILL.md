# Garden Recap (Session Wrap-up)

Capture the current session's work — what happened (Timeline) plus Keep / Problem / Try — into today's daily note. Designed to be invoked **before** the user ends a session so future sessions (today or later) can recover context without re-reading the entire transcript.

The normal path **drives the `recap.manual_recap` CLI** instead of hand-editing the daily note. The CLI upserts a per-session `kg-recap-sid:{sid8}` block — an append-only `### Timeline` plus a replaceable `### KPT` section — the SAME block the auto-recap `Stop` hook maintains. Manual and auto recaps therefore converge on one block per session.

## When to Use

- User says: "ここまで daily にまとめて" / "wrap up" / "今日の作業まとめて" / "recap this session" / "session を切る前に記録"
- About to switch tasks and want a clean handoff point
- End of a productive working block where context is worth preserving

## When NOT to Use

- A single durable insight needs capturing → `garden-plant` (atomic note, not daily journal entry)
- Updating a specific existing note → `garden-water`
- Just searching → `garden-survey`
- The session was trivial (read-only exploration, no outcomes): skip — don't pollute the daily note with empty recaps

## Process

The normal flow is four steps: identify the session, author the KPT, preview, apply. The CLI does the aggregation, block upsert, commit, and cursor advance — this skill does NOT hand-edit the daily note in the normal path. (A no-log recollection fallback is preserved under Step 2 for legacy sessions with no capture log.)

### Step 1: Pre-flight Setup

Follow [Pre-flight Setup](../using-knowledge-gardener/SKILL.md#pre-flight-setup-shared-by-all-operational-skills) in `using-knowledge-gardener` to resolve `$KG_VAULT` and load vault conventions. Additionally read the **daily-note template** and the **KPT convention** wherever the README points to them.

From the conventions + template, extract for this skill (at minimum):

- Where daily notes live (folder).
- How daily notes are named (filename convention).
- What the daily-note template looks like — sections, frontmatter, default tags.
- What language note bodies are written in.
- The vault's KPT convention (the Keep / Problem / Try section shape the recap block uses).
- The vault's link syntax.

If any of these are not discoverable from the README or templates, stop and ask the user. Do not invent defaults.

Format today's date per the filename convention and build the absolute daily-note path under the daily-note folder. Hold onto this path — Step 4 / Step 5 pass it to the CLI as `--daily-path`. The CLI only **appends** the `kg-recap-sid` recap block; it does **not** seed the daily-note template. So if today's note does not exist yet, create it from the template first (Write tool) so it carries the vault's frontmatter/sections, then run the CLI.

### Step 2: Identify the Session & Gather the Timeline

Identify the active session and confirm a capture log exists:

```bash
PYTHONPATH="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}" python3 -m recap.aggregate --json
```

By default this picks the most-recently-modified session log for today (≈ the active session). Parse `sessions[0].sid8` — this is the `<sid8>` you pass to the CLI in Steps 4–5. The Timeline the CLI will write is aggregated by the CLI itself from this same log; you do not assemble it by hand.

- If `sessions` is **non-empty** and `sessions[0].entry_count` is **> 0** → a capture log exists. Continue to **Step 3**.
- If `sessions` is **empty** OR `sessions[0].entry_count` is **0** → there is no capture log (older plugin install, or the session predates capture). The two-layer path cannot run; fall back to the **No-log fallback** below, then **STOP** (do not run `recap.manual_recap`).

#### No-log fallback (recollection)

Only for the no-capture-log case. This is the older free-form, template-driven recap: you hand-edit today's daily note from recollection + `git log`, exactly as before the two-layer CLI existed.

1. **Inventory from recollection + git** (don't make things up — only record what you can support from the conversation, file state, or `git log`):
   - **Time range**: session start (conversation start / the user's first substantive message) → `date` for "now".
   - **Outcomes**: what was decided / built / fixed / shipped this session? One sentence each.
   - **Files touched**: for each repo touched (identify from the conversation) run `git log --since='<session-start>' --oneline --author='<git user>'` (or `git log --since=<today-00:00> --oneline`); use `git diff --stat` for not-yet-committed work. Aggregate as a short list with one-line descriptions.
   - **New notes planted today**: query the vault for `date: <today>` frontmatter, or `git -C "$KG_VAULT/.." log --since=<today-00:00> --name-only`, to find newly-added notes.
   - **Decisions / principles surfaced** and **open follow-ups**: always from conversation context (the log records actions, not reasoning).
   - Cap each list to roughly the most-significant ~5 items. A recap is a summary, not a transcript.
2. **Locate today's daily note** (the path resolved in Step 1):
   - **Exists** → **append**. Read the file in full with the Read tool (not `Bash head/cat`, which doesn't count toward the Edit tool's per-file read tracking).
   - **Missing** → **new file**. Load the daily-note template as scaffold.
3. **Draft into the template's structure.** The daily-note template is the structure — fill each section it defines with content from your inventory. Don't invent sections it doesn't define. Write in the README's declared language and link syntax. For an append, do NOT overwrite earlier content: apply the README's multi-session convention if documented; otherwise integrate new bullets into the existing template sections without restructuring.
4. **Propose, don't commit.** Follow [Common: Propose, Don't Commit](../using-knowledge-gardener/SKILL.md#common-propose-dont-commit): show the target path, the diff (append) or full draft (new file), and the one-line rationale "Capturing today's session so the next one can pick up context." Trigger phrases "wrap up and write it" / "ここまでまとめて書いて" count as approval.
5. **Apply.** New note → **Write tool**; append → **Edit tool** (Read the file first; anchor on a stable template header rather than a long block markdownlint may have rewritten).
6. **Lint, commit, push.** Follow [Common: Lint, Commit, Push](../using-knowledge-gardener/SKILL.md#common-lint-commit-push). Subject: new note → `plant: <date> daily (session recap)`; append → `water: <date> daily session recap`. `<date>` matches the daily-note filename format. Don't `--no-verify`.

**Then STOP** — the no-log case is done here.

### Step 3: Author the KPT

A capture log exists (Step 2). From the **full conversation** (richer than the hook's transcript slice), write a `### KPT` section using the vault's KPT convention (Keep / Problem / Try, per the README/template). Cap each list to ~5 bullets.

- Facts for "what happened" come from the Timeline / conversation / `git log`. Keep / Problem / Try are *interpretation* — what to repeat, what hurt, what to try next.
- Write in the README's declared language and link syntax.
- Write the section to a temp file:

```bash
KPT_FILE="$(mktemp --suffix=.md)"
# write the "### KPT\n..." content into "$KPT_FILE" (Write tool)
```

The CLI replaces the block's existing KPT with this file's content; it does NOT touch the Timeline's prior entries.

### Step 4: Preview (Propose, Don't Commit)

With the daily-note path from Step 1 and `<sid8>` from Step 2, preview the upsert:

```bash
PYTHONPATH="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}" python3 -m recap.manual_recap \
  --sid <sid8> --daily-path <abs daily path> --kpt-file "$KPT_FILE" --dry-run
```

`--dry-run` prints a unified diff of the daily note and writes nothing. Show that diff to the user with the one-line rationale: "Capturing today's session into the per-session recap block so the next session can pick up context."

Trigger phrases that count as implicit approval: "wrap up and write it" / "ここまでまとめて書いて".

(Exit code 3 = nothing to recap — no session log. That shouldn't happen here because Step 2 already confirmed `entry_count > 0`; if it does, drop to the No-log fallback.)

### Step 5: Apply on Approval

Re-run the SAME command **without** `--dry-run`:

```bash
PYTHONPATH="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}" python3 -m recap.manual_recap \
  --sid <sid8> --daily-path <abs daily path> --kpt-file "$KPT_FILE"
```

The CLI writes the two-layer block atomically (Timeline append-with-dedup, KPT replace), derives the topic from the KPT's first `Keep:` bullet, commits (`water: <date> <HH:MM> 〜 <topic>`), and advances the per-session cursor — so a later auto `Stop` inherits this KPT as prior-KPT instead of overwriting it.

Don't `--no-verify` and don't hand-edit the block afterward. If you need a different insertion point for a brand-new block, pass `--insert-before <heading>` (default appends at EOF); to write without committing, pass `--no-commit`.

## Edge Cases

- **No daily-note convention documented**: the vault README doesn't tell you where daily notes go or how they're named → stop and ask the user; do not invent a location.
- **Daily folder doesn't exist** (vault layout differs from expectation): stop and surface the gap. Suggest the user pick the correct folder or update the README.
- **No capture log** (`sessions` empty or `entry_count` 0): take the **No-log fallback (recollection)** under Step 2, then stop. Don't try to force the CLI.
- **Block already exists for this session** (earlier manual recap, or an auto `Stop` already ran): re-running is safe — the CLI appends-with-dedup on the Timeline and replaces only the KPT. Review the `--dry-run` diff before applying so you don't clobber a richer KPT with a thinner one.
- **Session inventory turns up nothing meaningful**: tell the user "nothing significant to recap" rather than padding the daily note with filler. Better to skip than to write noise.
- **Pre-commit fails inside the CLI commit** (e.g. broken link in the KPT): fix the link in `$KPT_FILE` and re-run Step 5. Don't `--no-verify`.

## Key Principles

- **Evidence over recollection.** "What happened" comes from the Timeline / `git log` / actual conversation, not paraphrased memory. The CLI's Timeline is aggregated from the capture log, so the factual layer is mechanically grounded; only the KPT is your interpretation.
- **Preserve prior content on append.** Earlier Timeline entries — and the prior session's KPT once the cursor has advanced — are sacred. The CLI enforces this: Timeline is append-dedup, KPT-replace is scoped to the current session's block only. Add, don't replace.
- **One block per session.** Manual and auto recaps target the same `kg-recap-sid:{sid8}` block, so a session never ends up with two competing recaps.
- **One commit per recap.** The CLI makes exactly one `water:` commit. The daily note may collect multiple sessions, but each recap is its own commit so history stays readable.
- **Future-you reads this.** Write the KPT so that next session opens the daily note and immediately knows what shape today was in — what to keep doing, what hurt, what to try next.
- **Atomic, like the rest of the gardener.** Don't bundle "today's recap + tag fix + new permanent note" into one operation. Recap is one operation.
